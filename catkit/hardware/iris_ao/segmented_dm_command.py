"""
Holds the class SegmentedDmCommand that is used to create a dict that will be sent to the
segmented DM hardware as a command.


This module can be used to create a command in the following way:
    command = SegmentedDmCommand(dm_config_id, apply_flat_map=True,
                                 filename_flat='repo-path/hardware/iris-ao/CustomFLAT.ini')
    command.read_initial_values(segment_ptt_values)
    command.update_one_segment(segment_index, segment_ptt_values)
    command.display()
    dm_object.apply_shape(command)

Note that a command can be initialized from zeros, None, a list of tuples giving (P,T,T) for each segment,
an .ini file, or a .PTT### file. The PoppySegmentedDmCommand class can be used to create a command from
input Zernike coefficients.
Additionally, a single segment can be changed using the SegmentedDmCommand.update_one_segment()
method.
